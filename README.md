# linux-scripting
an assortment of scripts to ease the setup, installation and functioning for servers and computers mainly debian based.

Created mainly for use with both personal projects, private business and just anyone who needs an easier fix for an issue i have had along the way,

# server sided
all scripting meant solely for servers running purely a command line interface will be placed here

# desktop sided
all scripting meant to be helpful for desktop interface users, Trinity Desktop as an example but still using scripting as it tends to be faster and less error proned once the bugs are worked out.
